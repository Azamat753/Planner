    <string name="advice2">\"Get into the habit of keeping records of income and expenses electronically or in writing.\"</string>
    <string name="advice3_1">Get rid of credit cards, consumer loans, and other debt.</string>
    <string name="advice3_2">\" Debt is a psychological burden, putting people under stress and making them worry about the future. As a result, you will pay for using other people\'s money not only with your own money, but also with your health and energy.\"</string>
    <string name="advice4_1">Live within your means.</string>
    <string name="advice4_2">\" When you break this rule, you lose the harmony in your own life. You are spending money that you have not earned, In fact, using what does not belong to you, you can lose it at any time! Realize the difference between your needs — what you really need, and your desires — what "it would be nice to have".

    <string name="advice8_2">\" The secret to the financial stability of many successful people lies in multiple sources of income.\"</string>

    <string name="advice10_1">Do not lend money</string>

    <string name="advice11_2">\" A penny saves not only the ruble, but also the dollar and the euro!\"</string>
    <string name="advice12_1">Give up bad financial habits,</string>
    <string name="advice12_2">\" Regularly pulling money out of your wallet, but not bringing the old pleasure. We spend money to get some emotions. At the same price, different things can bring different amounts of emotions. For example, coffee in a cafe for 200 rubles, which you used to drink after lunch, no longer causes delight and satisfaction, but still costs your budget 1000 rubles a week. For the same thousand, you could get a lot more emotions by going to a massage or a movie.\"</string>
    <string name="advice13_1">Feel free to ask for a discount and take advantage of special offers.</string>
    <string name="advice13_2">\" The seller will probably be more profitable to offer you a discount and sell the product than to refuse the discount and not sell anything.\"</string>

    <string name="advice17_1">Investing is easier and more affordable than you think.</string>
    <string name="advice17_2">\" In addition, some financial instruments allow you to automate this process in many ways. The main thing is to understand whether it is so important to you that you are ready to start acting?\"</string>
    <string name="advice18_1">Buy the necessary high-quality things.</string>
    <string name="advice18_2">\" High-quality products, as a rule, are more expensive, but it is cheaper to use.\"</string>

    <string name="advice20_1">Always count the money, even if it is small.</string>
    <string name="advice20_2">\" Small daily expenses can add up to huge amounts over the years and even more over the decades.
